# React Native AsyncStorage: Handling Asynchronous Operations and Error Management

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications when working with AsyncStorage, specifically the improper handling of asynchronous operations and error management.

The `AsyncStorageBug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where the application attempts to access AsyncStorage data before the promise resolves, leading to undefined values and potential crashes. It also demonstrates the lack of proper error handling which can result in silent failures.

The `AsyncStorageSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper promise handling and error management, demonstrating best practices for using AsyncStorage in a React Native app.  This includes using `.then()` to handle successful resolution and `.catch()` for error handling. This example also shows how to perform multiple async operations sequentially and efficiently.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the app on your device or emulator.
4. Observe the behavior and compare the output of the two files to better understand the implications of improper AsyncStorage handling.
