In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store data, a common error is handling the asynchronous nature of the storage operations.  Forgetting to handle promises or using the results of AsyncStorage methods incorrectly can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. For example, attempting to use the result of `AsyncStorage.getItem` before the promise resolves will result in `undefined` being used.  Another subtle error occurs when incorrectly handling errors during `setItem` or `getItem`.  Failure to catch potential exceptions can lead to silent failures and data loss.
